# Custom one-stage group-by

## At a glance

`{disk.frame}` allows the user to enable create custom one-stage group-by functions. To make a function `fn` one stage. One needs to define two functions

1. `fn_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame` which applies itself to each chunk
2. `fn_df.collected_agg.disk.frame` which accepts a `list` of returns from `fn_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame` and finalize the computation

For example, to make `mean` a one-stage group-by function, `{disk.frame}` has defined `mean_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame` and `mean_df.collected_agg.disk.frame`, which we will illustrate with examples below.

But first, we shall explain some theory behind `{disk.frame}` to help you better understand "why does `{disk.frame}` do it like that?".

## How does `{disk.frame}` work

One may ask, how come only a few functions are supported for one-stage group-by? And why are some functions like `median` only produce estimates instead of producing the exact figure? To answer these question, we need to have an understanding of how `{disk.frame}` works.

A `disk.frame` is organized as chunks stored on disk. Each chunk is a file stored in [fst format](https://www.fstpackage.org/). The [`{future}` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=future) is used to apply the same function to each chunk, each of these operations are carried out in a separate R session. These R sessions cannot communicate with each other during the execution of the operations.

Once the operations have been performed on all chunks, the results will be bought back to the session from which the operations were called. This is the only point of inter-process communication. 

To summarize, the two phases of a `df %>% some_fn %>% collect` operation is 

1. The `some_fn` is applied to each chunk, and the result is assumed to be a data.frame
2. `collect` then row-binds (`rbind`/`bind_rows`/`rbindlist`) the results together to form a data.frame in the main session

## How group-by works

Except for passing the result back to the main session, communication between worker sessions are not allowed. This limits how group-by operations can be performed, hence why group-by was done in two stages prior to `{disk.frame}` v0.3.0. However, R's meta-programming abilities allow us to rewrite code to perform the two-stage group-bys using one-stage group-by code. For example, consider:

```r
df %>% 
  group_by(grp1) %>% 
  summarize(sum(x)) %>% 
  collect
```

we can use meta-programming to transform that to 
  
```r
df %>% 
  chunk_group_by(grp1) %>% 
  chunk_summarize(__tmp1__= sum(x)) %>% 
  collect() %>% 
  group_by(grp1) %>% 
  summarize(x = sum(__tmp1__))
```

Basically, we are "compiling" one-stage group-by code to two-stage group-by code, and then executing it.

For `mean`, it's trickier, as one needs to keep track on the numerator and the denominator separately in computing `mean(x) = sum(x)/length(x)`. 

Therefore, `{disk.frame}` compiles 

```r
df %>% 
  group_by(grp1) %>% 
  summarize(meanx = mean(x)) %>% 
  collect
```

to

```r
df %>% 
  chunk_group_by(grp1) %>% 
  chunk_summarize(__tmp1__ = list(mean_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame(x))) %>% 
  collect %>% 
  group_by(grp1) %>% 
  chunk_summarize(meanx = mean_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame(__tmp1__))
```

where `mean_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame` defines what needs to be done to each chunk, as you can see, the return value is a vector where the elements are named `sumx` and `lengthx`. Also note because the return value is not a scalar, we need to write it in a `list` (line 3). 

Here is an example implementation of `mean.chunk_agg.disk.frame`

```r
mean_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE, ...) {
  sumx = sum(x, na.rm = na.rm)
  lengthx = length(x) - ifelse(na.rm, sum(is.na(x)), 0)
  c(sumx = sumx, lengthx = lengthx)
}

```

The `mean_df.collected_agg.disk.frame` receives a list of outputs from `mean_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame`. Recall that `mean.chunk_agg.disk.frame` returns a vector for each chunk, so the input to `mean_df.collected_agg.disk.frame` is a *list of vectors*

```r
mean_df.collected_agg.disk.frame <- function(listx) {
  sum(sapply(listx, function(x) x["sumx"]))/sum(sapply(listx, function(x) x["lengthx"]))
}
```

## How to define custom one-stage group-by functions

Now that we have seen two examples, namely `sum` and `mean`, we are ready to summarize how group-by functions are implemented. 

Given the below

```r
df %>% 
  group_by(grp1) %>% 
  summarize(namex = fn(x)) %>% 
  collect
```

`{disk.frame}` compiles it to

```r
df %>% 
  chunk_group_by(grp1) %>% 
  chunk_summarize(__tmp1__ = list(fn_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame(x))) %>% 
  collect %>% 
  group_by(grp1) %>% 
  chunk_summarize(namex = fn_df.collected_agg.disk.frame(__tmp1__))
```

Based on the above information, to make `fn` a one-stage group-by function, the user has to

1. Define `fn_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame` which is a function to be applied to each chunk
2. Define `fn_df.collected_agg.disk.frame` which is a function to be applied to *a `list` containing the returns from `fn.chunk_agg.disk.frame` applied to each chunk*

**Example of implementing `sum`**:

1. Define `sum_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame`

```r
sum_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  sum(x, na.rm=na.rm)
}
```

2. Define `sum_df.collected_agg.disk.frame`, which needs to accept a list of `sum(x, na.rm)`, but `sum(x, na.rm)` is just a numeric, so

```r
sum_df.collected_agg.disk.frame <- function(list_sum) {
  sum(unlist(list_sum))
}
```

**Example of implementing `n_distinct`**:

The `dplyr::n_distinct` function counts the number of distint values from a vector `x`

1. Define `n_distinct_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame`, to return a list of unique values. Because the same value can appear in multiple chunks, to ensure that we don't double count, we simply return all the unique values from each chunk which is then de-duplicated in the next phase

```r
n_distinct_df.chunk_agg.disk.frame <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  if(na.rm) {
    setdiff(unique(x), NA)
  } else {
    unique(x)
  }
}
```

2. Define `n_distinct_df.collected_agg.disk.frame`, which de-duplicates the unique values

```r
n_distinct_df.collected_agg.disk.frame <- function(list_of_chunkwise_uniques) {
  dplyr::n_distinct(unlist(list_of_chunkwise_uniques))
}
```

## Limitations

We have seen that `{disk.frame}` performs operations in two phases 

1. apply the same function to each chunk
2. row-bind the results

and there are no communication between the sessions that applies the functions at chunk level.

Hence, it is generally difficult to compute rank based summarizations like `median` exactly. Hence most rank based calculations are estimates only. This is also true of distributed data system like Spark whose median function is also estimates only.

Another limitation for now is that summarization that is more complex then `f(x)` is not supported. E.g. `sum(x) + 1`, `sum(x + mean(x))`, `sum(x) + mean(x)`, and `fn(sum(x))` are not yet supported as arguments in the `summarize` function.
